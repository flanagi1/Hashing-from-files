# Hashing-from-files
This C++ program reads commands from a file to manipulate a hash table. Commands include inserting, deleting, and retrieving records based on a Social Security Number (SSN). It counts successful operations and measures the processing time. The results include the number of successful insertions, deletions, retrievals, and the total time elapsed.
