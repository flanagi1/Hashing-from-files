**Functionality:**

**Hash Table Implementation:**
The HashTable class manages an array of singly linked lists (SLL) for storing key-value pairs where the key is the SSN and the value is the associated name.
Basic operations include:
Insert: Adds a new entry if the SSN does not already exist.
Delete: Removes an entry based on the SSN.
Find: Searches for an entry by SSN.

**Singly Linked List:**
The SLL class manages a list of nodes. Each node contains an SSN, a name, and a pointer to the next node.
Operations include:
Insert: Adds a node to the front of the list.
Search: Looks for a node by SSN.
Remove: Deletes a node based on SSN.

**Main Function:**
Reads input data (operations for insertion, deletion, or retrieval) from a file specified as a command-line argument.
Tracks and displays statistics for each operation, including the number of valid insertions, deletions, and retrievals, along with the total number of entries and the time taken for execution.

**Efficiency:**

**Time Complexity:**
Insertion, Deletion, and Search: Average-case complexity is O(1) due to direct indexing in the hash table and linear traversal in the SLL. Worst-case complexity can be O(n) if many entries hash to the same index, leading to a long linked list.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of entries, as each entry requires space for both the hash table array and the linked lists.

**Collision Handling:**
The use of separate chaining with linked lists allows the hash table to handle collisions effectively, though the efficiency diminishes if many collisions occur.

**Summary:**
This code efficiently manages records using a hash table backed by linked lists. It supports basic CRUD operations with reasonable average-case performance, although it can degrade with poor hash function distribution. The implementation also provides insights into performance metrics, making it suitable for applications needing fast record management based on unique keys.
